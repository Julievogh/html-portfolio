<h1>The best movies according to Julie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<li><h3>Vanilla Sky</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie of all time! It is surrealistic, beautiful to behold, weird, romantic and malancolic. 
    <br>You will either love it or hate it. According to me, it is art as good as a Monet painting!</p></li>
<li><h3>Bohemian Rapsody</h3>
<p>Those who did not watch this movie in the cinema missed out on a beautiful experience! 
    <br>I never heard clapping after a movie - but after this most people clapped and then sat quietly thinking about <br>the experience they had just witnessed. Wonderful film!</p></li>
<li><h3>The Whale</h3>
<p>This is a more current film, that I really enjoyed. It deals with the most ugly parts of humankind, but also the most pure. 
    <br>I rolled out of the cinema gasping for air</p></li>
